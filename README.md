This is the central **development portal** of *BeeHub*, [SURFsara](http://www.surfsara.nl/)'s new file sharing service. BeeHub's **user portal** can be found at http://beehub.nl/.

This repository contains a number of different code-bases, that are so closely coupled that I didn't think they should live in separate git repositories.

*   **WebDAV:** the (BeeHub independent) custom WebDAV protocol implementation, as well as the BeeHub-specific XFS backend implementation.
*   **WebSite**: the [BeeHub user portal](http://beehub.nl/).
