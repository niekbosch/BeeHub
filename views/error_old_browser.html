<p><em>It looks like you're using Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 or earlier!</em></p>
<p>Internet Explorer version 8 and earlier do not support enough functionalities which are required by BeeHub. The website will work with Internet Explorer 9, although not all features are supported by this version (amongst which, the upload functionality). Therefore we advise you to upgrade your browser to at least Internet Explorer 9, but preferably version 10. Use the Windows Updater or download the newest version of <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/nl-nl/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer from their website</a>.</p>
<p>Windows XP does not support Internet Explorer versions newer than 8 and Windows Vista does not support Internet Explorer 10. Windows XP and Windows Vista users are advised to download either <a href="http://www.google.nl/intl/nl/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/fx/">Firefox</a> which both function perfectly on Windows XP.</p>
<p>In case you are working on a computer which doesn't allow you to install software on it (i.e. a workstation managed by your local IT department), you can have a look at <a href="http://portableapps.com/">Portable Apps</a>. They provide a wide range of (free and mostly open source) software which you don't have to install and can even run from an USB stick. This included the most recent versions of both <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable">Chrome</a> and <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Firefox</a>.</p>
