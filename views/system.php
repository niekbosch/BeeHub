<h1>BeeHub is...</h1>
<h5>Lots of Space</h5>
<p>BeeHub is grow-as-you-go. The amount of space is virtually unlimited. Don’t ask how much you can store, just upload as much as you want. We’ll keep up.</p>
<h5>Easy sharing of data</h5>
<p>BeeHub allows you to share your data with other BeeHub users. We have a unique, powerful, fine-grained, yet intuitive and simple way of setting access rights.</p>
<h5>Access from anywhere</h5>
<p>Your data is online. Your local desktop- or laptop-computer, mobile device or supercomputer doesn’t keep a copy of your data, as with DropBox. Hey, it’s way too much for that anyway, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Instead, you can mount our storage on almost any OS, including MS Windows, Linux, OSX (Mac), iOS and Android.</p>
<h5>Programmable Storage API</h5>
<p>BeeHub uses the WebDAV protocol, including all the more advanced features of WebDAV an HTTP, such as Locking, lost-update prevention, partial file up- and downloads, metadata management and more. All from your favorite programming language, as long as it has an HTTP library. You can even script it in Bash!</p>
